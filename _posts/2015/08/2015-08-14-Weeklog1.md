All right, so, here it goes, this is my first attempt to measure every week
what I do during the week. This way, I hope, I can compare with other weeks
and see whether the week has been productive or just it's not just my mind
who thinks I've been procastinating.

At work I've been tackling the differential rotation tool for SunPy which I
need so I can start to implement the python version of CorPITA. I started
from [an old attempt of Stuart][StuartGist]. The function works at the moment
for full disk images, but still there are few things to be done, the [pull-request
in SunPy][PR1530] shows some of these points (Aaahhh!! ephemerides are comming again!).
With our summer student at the Lab, [Mateo][mateoweb], we have also made some
progress with EIS, python and CHIANTI. Mateo has been already 7 weeks with us
integrating EIS tools in sunpy and python. Next week will give a talk about
all that he has done, which is a lot and it hasn't been easy.

Also at work this week has been quite succeful for the rest of the people in
my office and beyond in respect to open science. On one side I've teached
some to do testing on their software, and they've gotten the grip, on the
other I've *introduced* to someone to [Firefox][firefox], [Zotero][zotero]
(and [better bibtex][zotlatex]), [Sublime][sublime] and clarified a bit
the workflow with git.

Outside work, my GSOC student has done quite a lot of progress (I'm very
impressed) and helped Stuart with an application which deadline is NOW!
I've also managed to get back home in time to go to Tango dance lessons
(the Argentinian one!) and started to incubate ideas on what to do with
[Sunspotter][sunpotter] data.

Following weeks are going to be a bit crazy, I've volunteared myself for
quite a few talks/teaching, but it's going to be fun. Let's see if I keep
writing up on the blog.

Enjoy the weekend! (I may participate in a cycling competition)
