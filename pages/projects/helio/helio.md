The HELiophysics Integrated Observatory is an e-infrastructure project aimed
to help heliophysics researchers to discover new datasets.

My roles in this project were:

- liasing between scientists and developers,
- implement feature detection codes into the gridIreland
- test [event][hec] and [feature][hfc] catalogues
- help in the design of services (eg. [Unified Observing Catalogue][UOC])
- create [workflows][helio_workflows] using [Taverna][taverna]
- create a heliospheric propagation model: [SHEBA][SHEBA] ([source code][sheba_src])
- disemminate and provide training
 - [screen cast][yt_helio]
 - Talk at STEREO meeting
 - Talk at SIPWork (Switz)
 - Talk at SIPwork (Montana)
 - Talk at Summer School (Armagh)
 - Talk at Slovakia
 - Talk at FMI
- Organise Coordinated Data Analysis Workshop (Science and Local committee)
 - CDAW 0
 - CDAW 3
- Publications ([ADS][ads_helio], [GoogleScholar][scholar_helio])
 - [Studying Sun-Planet Connections Using the Heliophysics Integrated Observatory][doi_helio1] - OA

 
Funding of the project ended at the end of 2012, however the interfaces
are stil alive and maintain.
