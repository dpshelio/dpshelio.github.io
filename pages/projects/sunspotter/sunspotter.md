Sunspotter is a citizen science project from the
[zooniverse][zooniverse] platform where we are looking for insights on
solar flare activity based on the complexity of the magnetic signature
of active regions in the sun.
This project has been the first zooniverse project launched in Spanish and
English at the same time.

This project was started at [Trinity][tcd] by Paul Higgins, myself and others.
At the moment we had almost 4 million classifications done by more than 25,000 volunteers.

I'm in charge of:

- analysing the data
- support the Spanish community of volunteers
- co-maintain [blog][sunspotter_blog] and [twitter][sunspotter_tw] feeds.
